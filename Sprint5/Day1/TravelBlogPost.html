    <h3>Haridwar</h3>
    <p>Haridwar is regarded as a holy place for Hindus, hosting important religious events and serving as a gateway to
        several prominent places of worship. Most significant of the events is the Kumbha Mela, which is celebrated
        every 12 years in Haridwar. The city is situated on the right bank of the Ganges river, at the foothills of the
        Shivalik ranges.</p>

    <h3>Delhi</h3>
    <p>Delhi was the capital of two major empires, the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire, which covered large parts
        of South Asia. All three UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the city, the Qutub Minar, Humayun's Tomb, and the Red
        Fort, belong to this period. Delhi was the early centre of Sufism and Qawwali music. The names of Nizamuddin
        Auliya and Amir Khusrau are prominently associated with it. The Dehlavi dialect of Delhi was the earliest stage
        of the Hindustani language and part of a
        linguistic development that gave rise to the literature of Urdu and later Modern Standard Hindi.
        Major Urdu poets from Delhi include Mir Taqi Mir and Mirza Ghalib.</p>
