    <p>The Starry Night is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch Post-Impressionist painter Vincent van Gogh. Painted
        in June 1889, it depicts the view from the east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-RÃ©my-de-Provence, just
        before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village.</p>

    <p>The Mona Lisa is a half-length portrait painting by Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci. Considered an archetypal
        masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance, it has been described as "the best known, the most visited, the most
        written about, the most sung about, [and] the most parodied work of art in the world".</p>

    <p><strong>The Starry Night</strong><em> by Leonardo Do Vinci</em></p>
    <img src="./Images/The_Last_Supper_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci_1495_1498_800x.jpg" alt="The_Last_Supper" width="400px">
    <p>For more than 500 years of its existence, the famous fresco The Last Supper has been restored at least five
        times, and the last restoration took 21 years. This fresco by the great Leonardo depicts Jesus' last supper
        before his betrayal, arrest and death. In addition to composition, shapes and colors, discussions of this fresco
        are replete with theories about hidden symbols and the presence of Mary Magdalene next to Jesus.</p>
