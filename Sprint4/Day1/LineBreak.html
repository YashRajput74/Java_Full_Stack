    <h2>The Brook</h2>
    <h3>by Alfred Lord Tennyson</h3>

    <p>The Brook <br>

        I come from haunts of coot and hern, <br>
        I make a sudden sally, <br>
        And sparkle out among the fern, <br>
        To bicker down a valley. <br>
        <hr>

        By thirty hills I hurry down, <br>
        Or slip between the ridges, <br>
        By twenty thorps, a little town, <br>
        And half a hundred bridges. <br>
        <hr>

        Till last by Philip's farm I flow <br>
        To join the brimming river, <br>
        For men may come and men may go, <br>
        But I go on forever. <br>
        <hr>

        I chatter over stony ways, <br>
        In little sharps and trebles, <br>
        I bubble into eddying bays, <br>
        I babble on the pebbles. <br>
        <hr>

        With many a curve my banks I fret <br>
        by many a field and fallow, <br>
        And many a fairy foreland set <br>
        With willow-weed and mallow. <br>
        <hr>

        I chatter, chatter, as I flow <br>
        To join the brimming river, <br>
        For men may come and men may go, <br>
        But I go on forever. <br>
        <hr>

        I wind about, and in and out, <br>
        with here a blossom sailing,<br>
        And here and there a lusty trout, <br>
        And here and there a grayling, <br>
        <hr>

        And here and there a foamy flake <br>
        Upon me, as I travel <br>
        With many a silver water-break <br>
        Above the golden gravel, <br>
        <hr>

        And draw them all along, and flow <br>
        To join the brimming river, <br>
        For men may come and men may go, <br>
        But I go on forever. <br>
        <hr>

        I steal by lawns and grassy plots, <br>
        I slide by hazel covers; <br>
        I move the sweet forget-me-nots <br>
        That grow for happy lovers. <br>
        <hr>

        I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance, <br>
        Among my skimming swallows; <br>
        I make the netted sunbeam dance <br>
        Against my sandy shallows. <br>
        <hr>

        I murmur under moon and stars <br>
        In brambly wildernesses; <br>
        I linger by my shingly bars; <br>
        I loiter round my cresses;<br>
        <hr>

        And out again I curve and flow <br>
        To join the brimming river, <br>
        For men may come and men may go,<br>
        But I go on forever. <br>
        <hr>

        Alfred, Lord Tennyson
