        </li>
        <li>Delhi
            <ul>
                <li>Delhi was the capital of two major empires, the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire, which covered
                    large parts of South Asia. All three UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the city, the Qutub Minar,
                    Humayun's Tomb, and the Red Fort, belong to this period. Delhi was the early centre of Sufism and
                    Qawwali music. The names of Nizamuddin Auliya and Amir Khusrau are prominently associated with it.
                    The Dehlavi dialect of Delhi was the earliest stage of the Hindustani language and part of a
                    linguistic development that gave rise to the literature of Urdu and later Modern Standard Hindi.
                    Major Urdu poets from Delhi include Mir Taqi Mir and Mirza Ghalib.</li>
